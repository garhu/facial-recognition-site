            <p>
              The following document is an article for The New York Times. This
              article outlines issues with the use of facial recognition in law
              enforcement through the story of Robert Julian-Borchak Williams,
              the first person wrongfully arrested based on a flawed match from
              a facial recognition algorithm. The lack of regulations around
              this technology in the U.S. has led to multiple false arrests
              being made and it has further perpetuated racial tensions within
              the country. The purpose of this document is to educate the reader
              about this ongoing problem and bring awareness to the solutions
              that are proposed in the article. These readers would then be able
              to make more informed choices when voting for representatives and
              possibly encourage others to make a change as well.

              I am assuming that the average NYT reader has at least heard about
              facial recognition use in the past, as the NYT has written
              articles about it in the past. These readers are likely liberal,
              educated, and aware of current events. Out of these readers, those
              who are interested in social issues and police reform would want
              to read this article. While this group may have heard of this
              issue before, it is likely that they do not know the severity of
              the situation and the solutions outlined.
